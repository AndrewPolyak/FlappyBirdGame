# FlappyBirdGame
FlappyBirdGame is a JavaFX implementation of the iconic 'Flappy Bird'

The application allows you to select from three background options and six bird options. It tracks and displays your high score - and allows you to reset it at any time.

The Flappy Bird gameplay is what you'd expect: you control the bird by flapping, and the bird will fall due to gravity otherwise. Tubes will spawn with gaps at varying heights, and you score points by safely navigating your bird through the pipes.

If you intend to run this project on your local machine, you need to set the relevant classpath library paths and VM argument to enable JavaFX functionality (Universal EXE file may be implemented in the future).

Here is an overview of my version of Flappy Bird:

GAMEPLAY:
  - Press space to flap the bird to avoid the oncoming pipes
  - Your score will be tracked and your high score counter will be updated cross-application
  - Enjoy a video of me running through the main application (unfortunately there are some compression issues and a watermark, but the demo is still conveyed):
